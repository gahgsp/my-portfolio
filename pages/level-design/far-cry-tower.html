                  Level designed during the Level Design Lobby Bi-Weekly
                  Challenge.
                  <br />
                  The objective was to develop a level based on the mechanics
                  from the Far Cry series and create a traversal puzzle using
                  the concepts of the towers present on the game series.

                  Design one of the famous Far Cry towers.<br />
                  The tower should consist of: maximum of 5 enemies, a traversal
                  puzzle, interactions at the top and a maximum duration of 5
                  minutes.

                  After finishing the Far Cry 4 game, I had enough content to
                  build the tower and it's traversal puzzle. But, in order to
                  have a variety of styles in the challenges and puzzles, I
                  watched several gameplays from the previous games and I wrote
                  down some ideas from them.

                <h5>Basic Mechanics:</h5>
                <p
                  class="has-text-weight-light is-game-description has-gray-text"
                >
                  When I started brainstorming the ideas for the puzzles, I
                  decided that I should have the following mechanics: crouch,
                  climb a ladder and climb a rope.
                </p>
                <p

                >
                  For the basic FPS movement and to save some time, I downloaded
                  a FPS Asset from the Unity Asset Store. After that, I
                  customized and developed from scratch the three mechanics that
                  I set as required for the development of the level.

                <h5>Designing the Tower:</h5>
                <p
                  class="has-text-weight-light is-game-description has-gray-text"
                >
                  Before starting building the tower, I researched the average
                  size of the towers and I've found out that a tower with 6
                  floors is the most suitable in order to apply different
                  puzzles and mechanics.
                </p>
                <p
                  class="has-text-weight-light is-game-description has-gray-text"
                >
                  With that in mind, then I started designing the puzzles and
                  applying them to the floors. Using all the information I had
                  previously gathered this task came out to be really fun.
                </p>
                <p
                  class="has-text-weight-light is-game-description has-gray-text"
                >
                  I've tried to use as many puzzles as possible such as: findind
                  the tower entrance, walking on tight spaces and climbing ropes
                  that are high enough to kill the player.
                </p>
                <p
                  class="has-text-weight-light is-game-description has-gray-text"
                >
                  On the last floor, I've added the interaction required in the
                  task: once the player reaches the top, he can hack the signal.
                  The light at the top will then turn to green to show that the
                  tower was successfully hacked.
                </p>
                <h5>Feedback:</h5>
                <p
                  class="has-text-weight-light is-game-description has-gray-text"
                >
                  After some playtesting, I received the following feedbacks and
                  applied them to the level:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li
                    class="has-text-weight-light is-game-description has-gray-text"
                  >
                    Pacing: in the first version, there was no enemies on the
                    level. So, after the feedback I've added three enemies at
                    the entrace of the tower to change the pacing;
                  </li>
                  <li
                    class="has-text-weight-light is-game-description has-gray-text"
                  >
                    Tower Entrance: once the player reaches the base of the
                    tower, there are "obvious" entrances that are locked. So the
                    player can walk around the tower and see the entrance
                    through a hole in the wall. Even with that, the search was
                    quite easy, so I received the feedback to hide the main
                    entrance with some destructible boxes, another mechanic that
                    can be found on the games.
                  </li>
                </ul>
