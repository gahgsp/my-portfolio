                  The goal of this challenge was to recreate a dream / limbo
                  level where Dante can use his powers to traverse the map and
                  combat enemies.

                  For this challenge, I bought the game to get acquainted with
                  the game mechanics and researched different ideas from various
                  limbo/dream maps from the DmC game.

                  After a few hours of gameplay and research, I decided to make
                  my level based on the warehouse limbo level but trying to
                  apply as many as different mechanics that were applied on the
                  others levels as well.
                </p>
                <h5>Planning:</h5>
                <p

                >
                  Before diving into the blockout, I've decided to first create
                  a 2D top-down map that would facilitate the designing as well
                  as provide a quicker iteration through the changings on the
                  level that I would certainly have to make.
                  <br />
                  Creating a 2D top-down map allowed me to change and tweak the
                  map both in terms of length and organization, but also in a
                  way where I was able to change the pacing according to the
                  changes I was currently making to the level design as a whole.
                  <br />
                  As a matter of conclusion, having this top-down view of the
                  level before heading on to the blockout helped a lot and made
                  the level creation a lot quicker and precise.

                <p
                  class="has-text-weight-light is-game-description has-gray-text"
                >
                  In order to save time and focus more on the level design
                  itself, I bought this awesome Third Person Asset from the
                  Unity Store.
                  <br />
                  It is an incredible asset that comes with the basic
                  movimentation mechanics such as walking, jumping, running and
                  crouching.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  But, on the DmC game, Dante has a lot more of different
                  mechanics that needed implementation from myself. In the
                  already existing controller I was able to develop two game
                  mechanics that were essential to solve the traversal puzzles
                  on this level: the Ophion Pull and the Angel Boost.
                  <br />
                  It was a really fun challenge to customize an already existing
                  code and add new features to the asset.
                </p>
                <p
                  class="has-text-weight-light is-game-description has-gray-text"
                >
                  To be able to tweak and make changes to the new mechanics,
                  I've developed all of them in a way where customization and
                  changings are easy to make. The code was developed using
                  patterns that make it really simple to apply on different
                  characters and projects.

                <h5>Guiding the Player:</h5>
                <p

                >
                  After a certain point, the player will reach the remainings of
                  a warehouse that at first sight seems to block the way of the
                  player to the goal.
                  <br />
                  To help the player finding his way, I've used guiding lines
                  that show a possible path to the main objective. This ensures
                  that the player won't be lost and make him subconsciously
                  follow a pre-defined path.
                  <br />
                  The idea for the leading lines was to use objects that are
                  related to the environment's theme so it won't be perceived as
                  something disconnected from the level.
                  <br />
                  For this level I've used pipes and their positioning as
                  leading lines for the player.
